# Splunk Search Library (SPL)

A simple and organized collection of **SPL queries** used for troubleshooting and monitoring in **Splunk Cloud** and **Splunk Enterprise**.

This repo is divided into 3 categories:
- **performance** – searches for search head, indexers, and system health  
- **data-quality** – searches for verifying field quality and data completeness  
- **security-ops** – searches for authentication and basic security investigations  

All examples are safe, generic, and not based on real customer data.
